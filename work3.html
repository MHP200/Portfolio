          The primary user problem we identified was the significant loss
          experienced by people whose homes and belongings were destroyed by
          wildfires. We recognized the need for a centralized platform that
          would allow these individuals to communicate their needs and connect
          with generous donors who could provide support during the recovery
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle this challenge, we employed a variety of tools and methods.
          We conducted extensive user research to gain insights into the
          specific pain points and requirements of wildfire victims. This
          included interviews, surveys, and contextual inquiries to understand
          the emotional and practical aspects of their experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the findings, we proceeded with the UX design process, which
          involved defining user personas, creating wireframes and prototypes,
          and conducting iterative testing and refinement. We also utilized
          collaborative design workshops and brainstorming sessions to generate
          creative ideas and validate our design decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project, we employed industry-standard design tools
          such as Figma for creating visual designs and interactive prototypes.
          User testing sessions and feedback loops helped us validate and
          improve the app's usability, ensuring it met the needs of both
          wildfire victims and potential donors.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring the project to life, we utilized various tools and methods.
          Figma was our primary design and prototyping tool, allowing us to
          collaborate effectively and create high-fidelity designs.
          Additionally, we conducted user testing sessions using tools like Maze
          and conducted remote research interviews using platforms such as Zoom
          to gather feedback and validate our design choices.
