          The primary user problem we identified was the significant loss
          experienced by people whose homes and belongings were destroyed by
          wildfires. We recognized the need for a centralized platform that
          would allow these individuals to communicate their needs and connect
          with generous donors who could provide support during the recovery
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle this challenge, we employed a variety of tools and methods.
          We conducted extensive user research to gain insights into the
          specific pain points and requirements of wildfire victims. This
          included interviews, surveys, and contextual inquiries to understand
          the emotional and practical aspects of their experiences.
